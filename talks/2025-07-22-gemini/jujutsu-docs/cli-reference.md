<!-- The contents of the CLI reference is auto-generated by a Rust test.
 --- If `cargo insta` is installed, you can regenerate the CLI reference with:
 ---      cargo insta test --accept --workspace -- test_generate

!!! warning

    This CLI reference is experimental. It is automatically generated, but
    does not match the `jj help` output exactly.

    Run `jj help <COMMAND>` for more authoritative documentation.

    If you see a significant difference, feel free to file a bug, or a PR to note the difference here.
