## Welcome to `jj`'s documentation website!

<!-- This only applies to the website, not to the GitHub interface -->
The complete list of the available documentation pages is located in
the sidebar on the left of the page. The sidebar may be hidden; if so,
you can open it either by widening your browser window or by clicking
on the hamburger menu that appears in this situation.

Additional help is available using the `jj help` command if you have
`jj` installed.
