# Revsets

Jujutsu supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.
Expressions in this language are called "revsets" (the idea comes from
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/revsets)). The language
consists of symbols, operators, and functions.

Most `jj` commands accept a revset (or multiple). Many commands, such as
`jj edit <revset>` expect the revset to resolve to a single commit; it is an
error to pass a revset that resolves to more than one commit (or zero commits)
to such commands.

The words "revisions" and "commits" are used interchangeably in this document.

## Hidden revisions

Most revsets search only the [visible commits](glossary.md#visible-commits).
Other commits are only included if you explicitly mention them (e.g. by commit
ID, `<name>@<remote>` symbol, or `at_operation()` function).

If hidden commits are specified, their ancestors also become available to the
search space. They are included in `all()`, `x..`, `~x`, etc., but not in
`..visible_heads()`, etc. For example, `hidden_id | all()` is equivalent to
`hidden_id | ::(hidden_id | visible_heads())`.

## Symbols

The `@` expression refers to the working copy commit in the current workspace.
Use `<workspace name>@` to refer to the working-copy commit in another
workspace. Use `<name>@<remote>` to refer to a remote-tracking bookmark.

A full commit ID refers to a single commit. A unique prefix of the full commit
ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.

A full change ID refers to a visible commit with that change ID. A unique prefix
of the full change ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique
prefix or [a divergent change ID][divergent-change].

Use [single or double quotes][string-literals] to prevent a symbol from being
interpreted as an expression. For example, `"x-"` is the symbol `x-`, not the
parents of symbol `x`. Taking shell quoting into account, you may need to use
something like `jj log -r '"x-"'`.

[string-literals]: templates.md#string-literals

### Priority

Jujutsu attempts to resolve a symbol in the following order:

1. Tag name
2. Bookmark name
3. Git ref
4. Commit ID or change ID

To override the priority, use the appropriate [revset function](#functions). For
example, to resolve `abc` as a commit ID even if there happens to be a bookmark
by the same name, use `commit_id(abc)`. This is particularly useful in scripts.

## Operators

The following operators are supported. `x` and `y` below can be any revset, not
only symbols.

* `x-`: Parents of `x`, can be empty.
* `x+`: Children of `x`, can be empty.
* `x::`: Descendants of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Equivalent to
  `x::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `x..`: Revisions that are not ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to `~::x`, and
  `x..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `::x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Shorthand for
  `root()::x`.
* `..x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself, but excluding
  the root commit. Shorthand for `root()..x`. Equivalent to `::x ~ root()`.
* `x::y`: Descendants of `x` that are also ancestors of `y`. Equivalent
   to `x:: & ::y`. This is what `git log` calls `--ancestry-path x..y`.
* `x..y`: Ancestors of `y` that are not also ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to
  `::y ~ ::x`. This is what `git log` calls `x..y` (i.e. the same as we call it).
* `::`: All visible commits in the repo. Equivalent to `all()`, and
  `root()::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.
* `..`: All visible commits in the repo, but excluding the root commit.
  Equivalent to `~root()`, and `root()..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions
  are mentioned.
* `~x`: Revisions that are not in `x`.
* `x & y`: Revisions that are in both `x` and `y`.
* `x ~ y`: Revisions that are in `x` but not in `y`.
* `x | y`: Revisions that are in either `x` or `y` (or both).

(listed in order of binding strengths)

You can use parentheses to control evaluation order, such as `(x & y) | z` or
`x & (y | z)`.

## Functions

You can also specify revisions by using functions. Some functions take other
revsets (expressions) as arguments.

* `parents(x[, depth])`: `parents(x)` is the same as `x-`.
  `parents(x, depth)` returns the parents of `x` at the given `depth`. For
  instance, `parents(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x---`.

* `children(x[, depth])`: `children(x)` is the same as `x+`.
  `children(x, depth)` returns the children of `x` at the given `depth`. For
  instance, `children(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x+++`.

* `ancestors(x[, depth])`: `ancestors(x)` is the same as `::x`.
  `ancestors(x, depth)` returns the ancestors of `x` limited to the given
  `depth`.

* `descendants(x[, depth])`: `descendants(x)` is the same as `x::`.
  `descendants(x, depth)` returns the descendants of `x` limited to the given
  `depth`.

* `reachable(srcs, domain)`: All commits reachable from `srcs` within
  `domain`, traversing all parent and child edges.

* `connected(x)`: Same as `x::x`. Useful when `x` includes several commits.

* `all()`: All visible commits and ancestors of commits explicitly mentioned.

* `none()`: No commits. This function is rarely useful; it is provided for
  completeness.

* `change_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given change ID prefix. If the specified
  change is divergent, this resolves to multiple commits. It is an error to use a
  non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.

* `commit_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given commit ID prefix. It is an error
  to use a non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.

* `bookmarks([pattern])`: All local bookmark targets. If `pattern` is specified,
  this selects the bookmarks whose name match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `bookmarks(push)` would match the
  bookmarks `push-123` and `repushed` but not the bookmark `main`. If a bookmark is
  in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern[, [remote=]remote_pattern]])`: All remote
  bookmarks targets across all remotes. If just the `bookmark_pattern` is
  specified, the bookmarks whose names match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns) across all remotes are selected. If both
  `bookmark_pattern` and `remote_pattern` are specified, the selection is
  further restricted to just the remotes whose names match `remote_pattern`.

  For example, `remote_bookmarks(push, ri)` would match the bookmarks
  `push-123@origin` and `repushed@private` but not `push-123@upstream` or
  `main@origin` or `main@upstream`. If a bookmark is in a conflicted state, all
  its possible targets are included.

  While Git-tracking bookmarks can be selected by `<name>@git`, these bookmarks
  aren't included in `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `tracked_remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern[, [remote=]remote_pattern]])`: All
  targets of tracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as
  `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `untracked_remote_bookmarks([bookmark_pattern[, [remote=]remote_pattern]])`:
  All targets of untracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments
  as `remote_bookmarks()`.

* `tags([pattern])`: All tag targets. If `pattern` is specified,
  this selects the tags whose name match the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `tags(v1)` would match the
  tags `v123` and `rev1` but not the tag `v2`. If a tag is
  in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `git_refs()`:  All Git ref targets as of the last import. If a Git ref
  is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.

* `git_head()`: The Git `HEAD` target as of the last import.

* `visible_heads()`: All visible heads (same as `heads(all())` if no hidden
  revisions are mentioned).

* `root()`: The virtual commit that is the oldest ancestor of all other commits.

* `heads(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not ancestors of other commits in `x`.
  Equivalent to `x ~ ::x-`. Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `heads(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x-`.

* `roots(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not descendants of other commits in `x`.
  Equivalent to `x ~ x+::`. Note that this is different from
  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `roots(x)`
  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x+`.

* `latest(x[, count])`: Latest `count` commits in `x`, based on committer
  timestamp. The default `count` is 1.

* `fork_point(x)`: The fork point of all commits in `x`. The fork point is the
  common ancestor(s) of all commits in `x` which do not have any descendants
  that are also common ancestors of all commits in `x`. It is equivalent to
  the revset `heads(::x_1 & ::x_2 & ... & ::x_N)`, where `x_{1..N}` are commits
  in `x`. If `x` resolves to a single commit, `fork_point(x)` resolves to `x`.

* `merges()`: Merge commits.

* `description(pattern)`: Commits that have a description matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

  A non-empty description is usually terminated with newline character. For
  example, `description(exact:"")` matches commits without description, and
  `description(exact:"foo\n")` matches commits with description `"foo\n"`.

* `subject(pattern)`: Commits that have a subject matching the given [string
  pattern](#string-patterns). A subject is the first line of the description
  (without newline character.)

* `author(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name or email matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns). Equivalent to `author_name(pattern) |
  author_email(pattern)`.

* `author_name(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `author_email(pattern)`: Commits with the author's email matching the given
  [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `author_date(pattern)`: Commits with author dates matching the specified [date
  pattern](#date-patterns).

* `mine()`: Commits where the author's email matches the email of the current
  user. Equivalent to `author_email(exact-i:<user-email>)`

* `committer(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's name or email matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns). Equivalent to
  `committer_name(pattern) | committer_email(pattern)`.

* `committer_name(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's name matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `committer_email(pattern)`: Commits with the committer's email matching the
  given [string pattern](#string-patterns).

* `committer_date(pattern)`: Commits with committer dates matching the specified
  [date pattern](#date-patterns).

* `signed()`: Commits that are cryptographically signed.

* `empty()`: Commits modifying no files. This also includes `merges()` without
  user modifications and `root()`.

* `files(expression)`: Commits modifying paths matching the given [fileset
  expression](filesets.md).

  Paths are relative to the directory `jj` was invoked from. A directory name
  will match all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

  For example, `files(foo)` will match files `foo`, `foo/bar`, `foo/bar/baz`.
  It will *not* match `foobar` or `bar/foo`.

  Some file patterns might need quoting because the `expression` must also be
  parsable as a revset. For example, `.` has to be quoted in `files(".")`.

* `diff_contains(text[, files])`: Commits containing diffs matching the given
  `text` pattern line by line.

  The search paths can be narrowed by the `files` expression. All modified files
  are scanned by default, but it is likely to change in future version to
  respect the command line path arguments.

  For example, `diff_contains("TODO", "src")` will search revisions where "TODO"
  is added to or removed from files under "src".

* `conflicts()`: Commits with conflicts.

* `present(x)`: Same as `x`, but evaluated to `none()` if any of the commits
  in `x` doesn't exist (e.g. is an unknown bookmark name.)

* `coalesce(revsets...)`: Commits in the first revset in the list of `revsets`
  which does not evaluate to `none()`. If all revsets evaluate to `none()`, then
  the result of `coalesce` will also be `none()`.

* `working_copies()`: The working copy commits across all the workspaces.

* `at_operation(op, x)`: Evaluates `x` at the specified [operation][]. For
  example, `at_operation(@-, visible_heads())` will return all heads which were
  visible at the previous operation.

  Since `at_operation(op, x)` brings all commits that were visible at the
  operation to the search space, `at_operation(op, x) | all()` is equivalent to
  `at_operation(op, x) | ::(at_operation(op, x | visible_heads()) |
  visible_heads())`.

## String patterns

Functions that perform string matching support the following pattern syntax (the
quotes are optional):

* `"string"` or `substring:"string"`: Matches strings that contain `string`.
* `exact:"string"`: Matches strings exactly equal to `string`.
* `glob:"pattern"`: Matches strings with Unix-style shell [wildcard
  `pattern`](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).
* `regex:"pattern"`: Matches substrings with [regular
  expression `pattern`](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

You can append `-i` after the kind to match case‐insensitively (e.g.
`glob-i:"fix*jpeg*"`).

## Date patterns

Functions that perform date matching support the following pattern syntax:

* `after:"string"`: Matches dates exactly at or after the given date.
* `before:"string"`: Matches dates before, but not including, the given date.

Date strings can be specified in several forms, including:

* 2024-02-01
* 2024-02-01T12:00:00
* 2024-02-01T12:00:00-08:00
* 2024-02-01 12:00:00
* 2 days ago
* 5 minutes ago
* yesterday
* yesterday 5pm
* yesterday 10:30
* yesterday 15:30

## Aliases

New symbols and functions can be defined in the config file, by using any
combination of the predefined symbols/functions and other aliases.

Alias functions can be overloaded by the number of parameters. However, builtin
function will be shadowed by name, and can't co-exist with aliases.

For example:

```toml
[revset-aliases]
'HEAD' = '@-'
'user()' = 'user("me@example.org")'
'user(x)' = 'author(x) | committer(x)'
```

### Built-in Aliases

The following aliases are built-in and used for certain operations. These functions
are defined as aliases in order to allow you to overwrite them as needed.
See [revsets.toml](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/revsets.toml)
for a comprehensive list.

* `trunk()`: Resolves to the head commit for the trunk bookmark of the remote
  named `origin` or `upstream`. The bookmarks `main`, `master`, and `trunk` are
  tried. If more than one potential trunk commit exists, the newest one is
  chosen. If none of the bookmarks exist, the revset evaluates to `root()`.

  When working with an existing Git repository (via `jj git clone` or
  `jj git init`), `trunk()` will be overridden at the repository level
  to the default bookmark of the remote `origin`.

  You can [override](./config.md) this as appropriate. If you do, make sure it
  always resolves to exactly one commit. For example:

  ```toml
  [revset-aliases]
  'trunk()' = 'your-bookmark@your-remote'
  ```

* `builtin_immutable_heads()`: Resolves to
  `present(trunk()) | tags() | untracked_remote_bookmarks()`. It is used as the
   default definition for `immutable_heads()` below. It is not recommended to
   redefine this alias. Prefer to redefine `immutable_heads()` instead.

* `immutable_heads()`: Resolves to
  `present(trunk()) | tags() | untracked_remote_bookmarks()` by default. It is
  actually defined as `builtin_immutable_heads()`, and can be overridden as
  required. See [here](config.md#set-of-immutable-commits) for details.

* `immutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as immutable. This is
  equivalent to `::(immutable_heads() | root())`. It is not recommended to redefine
  this alias. Note that modifying this will *not* change whether a commit is immutable.
  To do that, edit `immutable_heads()`.

* `mutable()`: The set of commits that `jj` treats as mutable. This is
  equivalent to `~immutable()`. It is not recommended to redefined this alias.
  Note that modifying this will *not* change whether a commit is immutable.
  To do that, edit `immutable_heads()`.


## The `all:` modifier

Certain commands (such as `jj rebase`) can take multiple revset arguments, and
each of these may resolve to one-or-many revisions.

If you set the `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` option to `false`, `jj` will not
allow revsets that resolve to more than one revision &mdash; a so-called "large
revset" &mdash; and will ask you to confirm that you want to proceed by
prefixing it with the `all:` modifier. *This option is planned to be removed.*

An `all:` modifier before a revset expression does not otherwise change its
meaning. Strictly speaking, it is not part of the revset language. The notation
is similar to the modifiers like `glob:` allowed before [string
patterns](#string-patterns).

For example, `jj rebase -r w -d xyz+` will rebase `w` on top of the child of
`xyz` as long as `xyz` has exactly one child.

If `xyz` has more than one child, the `all:` modifier is *not* specified, and
`ui.always-allow-large-revsets` is `false`, `jj rebase -r w -d xyz+` will return
an error.

If `ui.always-allow-large-revsets` was `true` (the default), the above command
would act as if `all:` was set (see the next paragraph).

With the `all:` modifier, `jj rebase -r w -d all:xyz+` will make `w` into a merge
commit if `xyz` has more than one child. The `all:` modifier confirms that the
user expected `xyz` to have more than one child.

A more useful example: if `w` is a merge commit, `jj rebase -s w -d all:w- -d
xyz` will add `xyz` to the list of `w`'s parents.

## Examples

Show the parent(s) of the working-copy commit (like `git log -1 HEAD`):

```shell
jj log -r @-
```

Show all ancestors of the working copy (like plain `git log`)

```shell
jj log -r ::@
```

Show commits not on any remote bookmark:

```shell
jj log -r 'remote_bookmarks()..'
```

Show commits not on `origin` (if you have other remotes like `fork`):

```shell
jj log -r 'remote_bookmarks(remote=origin)..'
```

Show the initial commits in the repo (the ones Git calls "root commits"):

```shell
jj log -r 'root()+'
```

Show some important commits (like `git --simplify-by-decoration`):

```shell
jj log -r 'tags() | bookmarks()'
```

Show local commits leading up to the working copy, as well as descendants of
those commits:


```shell
jj log -r '(remote_bookmarks()..@)::'
```

Show commits authored by "martinvonz" and containing the word "reset" in the
description:

```shell
jj log -r 'author(martinvonz) & description(reset)'
```
