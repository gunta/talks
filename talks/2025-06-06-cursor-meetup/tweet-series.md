# Cursor Meetup Tokyo Tweet Series

## Main Thread - Event Announcement

```
🚀 Last Friday's Cursor Meetup Tokyo was INSANE! 

200+ offline attendees
6,000 pre-registered 
12K+ YouTube views already!

I shared how @CyberAgent_PR adopted @cursor_ai across 3,000 engineers using a "viral strategy" - because top-down doesn't work in Japan 🇯🇵

Slides: https://dub.sh/cursor-tokyo-ca

🧵👇
```

```
The reactions were incredible! Engineers, PMs, designers all asking "When can we get this?"

My key message: "Using AI for development is no longer optional - it's like doing accounting without a calculator"

Expect massive traffic from Japan in the coming weeks/months 📈
```

```
Key insights from my talk:

1️⃣ External events are the strongest internal sales tool
2️⃣ Future company value = MCP server count  
3️⃣ Context is KING - never leave Cursor
4️⃣ The ultimate AI dev stack exists (and I shared it!)

```
Huge thanks to @kinopee_ai, Japan's Cursor Ambassador, for inviting me to speak! 🙏

His vision to bring together the AI developer community through AIAU has created something special. This event wouldn't have happened without his leadership.

Follow him for more Japan AI updates! 🇯🇵✨

## Cursor Tweet

```
Hey @mntruell @amanrsanger @cursor_ai team! 

Japan is now your #3 market (up from #4!) 🇯🇵

At Cursor Meetup Tokyo, I showed how we're rolling out Cursor to 3,000+ engineers at @CyberAgent_PR

The secret? $15/month gets unlimited access to ALL models - that's the killer feature!

https://dub.sh/cursor-tokyo-ca
```

```
@cursor_ai The crowd went WILD when I showed:

- Our Spindle Design System MCP: 10x productivity boost
- Real metrics: 1-2 features/day → 5-8 features/day
- Bug rate: 15% → 3%
- Code review time: 2 hours → 30 min

This isn't hype. This is reality in Japan 🇯🇵

## Mastra Tweet

```
.@mastra_ai @sourabpramanik @nishilfaldu - Japan is ready for AI agents! 

In my Cursor Meetup talk, I revealed Mastra as part of my "secret sauce" Vibe Coding Stack

Why? Perfect for building MCP servers & AI workflows. We're already building multiple agent systems at @CyberAgent_PR

https://dub.sh/cursor-tokyo-ca
```

```
@mastra_ai The audience loved my MCP workflow:

1️⃣ Manual work in Cursor
2️⃣ MCP-ify with Mastra  
3️⃣ Agent-ify the workflow
4️⃣ Monetize as MCP SaaS

Already built & selling recruitment MCP, expense MCP, and more. $500-2000 MRR each!

## Convex Tweet

```
.@convex_dev @JamesCowling @sujayakar - Convex is THE backend for AI development!

At Cursor Meetup Tokyo, I shared why Convex is essential:
✅ Complete e2e type safety = AI doesn't make mistakes
✅ Real-time by default
✅ No SQL = faster iteration
✅ Perfect schema enforcement

12K+ devs saw this! 🚀

https://dub.sh/cursor-tokyo-ca
```

```
@convex_dev @JamesCowling The reaction when I said "NO SQL!" was priceless 😄

Japanese developers are tired of:
- Version mismatches
- AI hallucinating database schemas  
- Slow iteration cycles

Convex solves ALL of this. That's why it's my secret weapon.

## Expo Tweet

```
.@expo @baconbrix @EvanBacon @brentvatne - Native apps + AI = the future!

Showed 6,000+ developers at Cursor Meetup how Expo completes our AI stack at @CyberAgent_PR

With Cursor + Expo, we're shipping mobile apps in hours, not weeks. Japan's mobile-first market is ready for this!

https://dub.sh/cursor-tokyo-ca
```

```
@expo @notbrent The "Opinionated Stack" slide got the most photos 📸

Why Expo?
- Japan = mobile-first market
- AI can generate React Native perfectly
- Ship to App Store in hours
- Works seamlessly with @convex_dev

This is how we're 10x-ing mobile development!

## Follow-up Thread on MCP

```
🔥 Hot take from my talk: "Future company valuation = MCP server count"

We're building 100+ internal MCP servers at @CyberAgent_PR:
- Spindle Design System MCP (10x productivity!)
- Security monitoring
- Internal dictionary
- Task management

The goal? More MCP servers than employees!
```

```
For those asking about our "Vibe Coding Stack":

🤖 AI Agents: @mastra_ai
💾 Backend/Frontend: @convex_dev  
📱 Native Apps: @expo
☁️ Hosting: @Cloudflare
🎨 IDE: @cursor_ai

This stack = 10x productivity. Not exaggeration, actual measured results.

Full details in slides 👆
```

```
Why this stack?

@cursor_ai - Context is king
@mastra_ai - MCP made easy
@convex_dev - No SQL, full type safety
@expo - Mobile in hours
@Cloudflare - Deploy instantly

It's not about individual tools. It's about the SYNERGY.

## Bonus Tweet - Japanese Market

```
🇯🇵 To all tech companies: Japan is your sleeping giant market!

After our Cursor Meetup:
- Connpass servers crashed from traffic
- Companies calling Monday morning
- Engineers sharing internally
- C-suite asking "when do we adopt?"

The AI coding revolution in Japan starts NOW 🚀
```

## Additional Insights Thread

```
The most asked question: "How did you get 3,000 engineers to adopt Cursor?"

Answer: I didn't use top-down. I used a VIRAL strategy:

1. Used it myself for 2 years
2. Created success stories
3. Hosted external events
4. Let external pressure drive internal adoption

It worked! 🎯
```

```
"LLMs are trained on old StackOverflow code" got the biggest nods

That's why we use:
- Cursor Rules
- MCP documentation servers
- @convex_dev with full type info

Give AI the latest "textbooks" and watch the magic happen ✨

```

```
My favorite reaction: When I showed our internal MCP servers

"Wait, you have an MCP for your design system?"
"And one for internal dictionary?"
"And security monitoring?"

YES! Everything becomes an MCP. That's the future.

Start building yours today 🚀
```

```
Special shoutout to the amazing AIAU community led by @kinopee_ai! 

What started as a small Discord group has become Japan's premier AI developer community. This Cursor Meetup proved that Japan is ready to lead the AI coding revolution.

Join the movement! 🇯🇵🚀
