# Presentation Main concept

This is the main concept that should be embedded in the whole theme.

## なぜ、いま開発を変えるのか

世界は変わった。開発の常識が、いま大きく動き出している。
まだチャットボットとコード補完で消耗してるのか？ 
それじゃ遅すぎる。

AIは既に、想像を超えた領域に到達している。 
開発速度は5倍、いや、それ以上へ。 
これは誇張でも幻想でもない。

Cursor、Windsurf、Cline—— 
これらは新時代を切り開く鍵だ。

2025年はエージェントの年だ。 
Sam Altmanも言った—— 
「2025年末のソフトウェアエンジニアリングは、
年初とは全く異なるものになる」

この革命の最前線に、俺達は立つ。
日本から、世界へ。

# Intro (storytelling)
"Connecting the dots"

[why image]
> Hi, my name is Günther.
> In order for you to understand why I created this event, I need to start tell you guys a personal story.

> Let's go back in time.

# Place of Birth

> I was born in Argentina
[cool buenos aires night scene]
[oposite side of the world graph]

> Perhaps you've heard of it, the most far away country in the world.

You might know it for some persons also:

# Elementary School
When I was in Elementary school, I liked maths so much that I got in the Olympic Maths.

[maths olimpics studying student]

# First anime that got me hooked
When i was in Elementary school I also was watching the Saint Seiya anime.

Because the story is located in Greece, I thought this animation was made in Greece.
So I my dream was to go to Greece when I become adult.

# So in High School
I went to a technical school to study Electronics and started making robots.
From resistency to transistor.
Programming in Assembly and C. Very low level.

# Then I got onto Software
So I started studying Computer Science.
Hello C++ I love C++.
My idols were Bjarne Stroustrup and John Carmack.

[screen photo of c++ hello world]

# And started making Open Source

There was a very ugly site called SourceForge.
Still exists but everyone forgot it for GitHub.

I was contributing to a C++ IDE called Code::Blocks (omg it is still being maintained to this date!)

I started contributing C++ OSS.
The tech was good, portable and universal but...
have you ever heard of it???

Btw main developer is Greek.

But it never got popular.

[sourceforge image]

# I struggled to make more people aware and download it
It never got traction.

Since I was confident in my left-brain 理系 part already.
But I've never explored my right-part.

[image of 理系 vs 文系]

# Design
So I decided I should also give it a shot at studying Design if I ever wanted to create something nice that people actually want.
But I was definitely almost sure that I will not be able to get good sense. 
I thought "Design" was something like a gift, some innate power when you are born.
But, I like challenges.

[Challenge image]

# At that time, something happened

As most students around the world, I got same hobbies: Games, Anime, Music.
This is how I knew there was a country called Japan.
Wow. It was not Greece.

# The roots: I got so much into it
With friends we started organizing events around Japanese Anime, Music and Cosplay.
It got very big and popular, we started renting the biggest venues.
It got even popular outside Otaku culture, because the "content was interesting".
5000 participants was the last one.
Huge cosplay contests, ramen and 屋台, Japanese Music, etc. Like a 祭り！

# At this time I got extremely inspired by 3 Japanese creators
They made me want to actually go to Japan.
These guys can do all alone. How, why? So much talent.
Oh. I want to learn that "Producing skill".
Where is the limit?

The best ones mix multiple skills.
Looks like trying to have only one skill doesn't work.

[Yoshiki]: Being able to compose and play multiple instruments, even in the same song.
[Makoto Shinkai]: Being able to create Anime all alone, even he doing the voice! And he was using Mac even 25 years ago.
[Shigeru Miyamoto]: Designed and produced from zero and creating prototypes for Mario, Zelda, etc.

# THen: Apple
Since Shinkai Makoto was using Mac. I got into it.
And I discovered about Steve Jobs.
And wow looks so cool. 
iMac with colors transparent! iPod!

# Zen
The founder of Apple and others like him know that telling the right story brings your idea to life. That story is how you convince other people to give you their backing.
How does Zen fit into these things? It all has to do with letting go. But we don’t let go to create eternal emptiness. We do it to reflect, grow stronger, and make space for the new.
To be truly Zen, you must consider these three principles:
1. Zen fosters a state of calm emptiness into which empathy can flow.
2. Zen makes experimentation possible because it eliminates the fear of failure.
3. Zen traditionally uses short parables to teach life lessons. Storytelling is an integral part of Zen.

# Kyoto
Steve Jobs have always found Buddhism—Japanese Zen Buddhism in particular—to be aesthetically sublime The most sublime thing I’ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto.
Steve Jobs loved Saihoji (kokedera), prestigious Kyoto Zen temple with beautiful Zen garden.
And Ryoan-ji 竜安寺 方丈庭園 specially.
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,”

# Adobe
In Adobe’s State of Create: in a Survey, Japan (the home of Zen) was rated as the world’s most creative country. Clearly, Steve Jobs is not the only person to have found inspiration in Japan.

# OK!
So it looks that the next step is very clear: I need to go to Japan to study the best design.
Why not? If we're gonna do impossible challenge of learning "design sense",
let's go hard and do it in the best place and in a hard to learn language.

# CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
But, oh Japan is (was) expensive.
SO I went to the Japanese embassy and found they have a 留学プログラム.
The Japanese goverment gives each year a chance for overseas students to travel and learn.

# NOT SO FAST
THe exam is nothing like I was used to.
Ie. "Long time Deep Thinking problems for math".
But more "memorize everything so you don't need to think" 暗記.
So I failed miserabily, 3 years in a row :(

# 狭い門
Usually only zero / one in around 50 ppl can get the schoolarship.
But I got it in the last chance!! I learned the "Japanese Way" of 暗記。
I became an LLM for Japanese exams.

# Because ACTUALLY PRETTY AMAZING
The schoolarship gives you not only ticket plane in JAL. 
But also paid 学費 and even allowance per month 生活費.
No need to return anything. No need to leave or stay the country.
Just ride the plane!
Is this too good to be true? WHere is the catch?
Looks suspicious Mmm. 
Also I am not sure I will be able to learn a language so different. Mmm.
But later I discovered there is a secret to it.

# This talk is sponsored by MEXT（文部科学省）
Thanks! ありがとう！

# ARRIVED TO JAPAN
こんにちは東京！
ただいま！はじめまして！ぐらいしか話せない状態で来日してきました！

# So I studied 1 year of Japanese
日本語を1年間勉強して、今のレベルを獲得した。

# Arubaito
At this time to learn more Japanese I did lots of part times jobs.
Actuallyこの辺だけAIに置き換えられない。
結婚式場のホール、ホテルの結婚式のバーテンダー、
テレビCM（例：Jリーグ）、
映画撮影（例：松本清張のゼロの焦点）
再現VTR（例: アンビリバボー）

# この辺はAIに置き換えられる
翻訳（例：日本政府の翻訳、今でもやってる）

# Then I studied 2 years of Graphics Design
At the beggining I was very bad.
But trought 2 years, I learned how to learn Design and get a good sense.
And its actually extremely easy!!

# Design and Good sense is just RLHF
Really, I just make something in Illustrator and the 先生は指摘される。
その指摘されるたびに覚える。完全にRLHFされるだけ！
気づいたら感覚としてセンスが上がっていく。
「センスは磨くもの」は本当だった。
LLMと同じや！

# I join a IT JP Venture Company
Every other company was doing ガラケー.
This one was doing Apps for iOS before Android even existed!!
So I was doing: design in Photoshop, coding in Dreamweaver, 
Programming in Flash, Doing Server in PHP, Native Apps...

# So
I was thinking about the what was the point of 文部科学省の奨学金。
Then I noticed:
1. Foreigners staying in Japan (me): Since get 行動人材ビザ認定される可能性高い
すぐ所得税で何十倍も返した！！
2. Foreigners returning to their countries
Since they speak Japanese now, they will definitely gonna do 貿易 with Japan,
and always have a preferential treatment with Japan.

Mmm 日本の政府はNice stealth investment! Appreciated.


# Then in 2012, CyberAgent was doing スマホシフト
I join here (ups, 13 years ago)!
And I find something very weird!

# 2012 分業がベストプラクティスの時代
Everything was completely separated!
Not only backend or design, but,
Even the JS Programmer（フロントエンド職） was separated from HTML/CSS（コーダー職）, and so on.
What?　But because there is so much to be done, this was better in order to release faster.
Made sense for companies with budget.

# Game Programming: Android was my enemy
Because I was doing game programming, I noticed most of the time spent wwas not actually developing,
but testing the games in Android real smartphones.
Fixing one bug and appearing in other. Total chaos, unbereable.

# So I gave a shot
Along a co-worker, I decided to fix the problem of manual testing.
I created a system called OpenSTF. 
Realtime remote controlling, testing and debugging.

# So I make OpenSTF
I made it open source.
This time with nice UI.
And it got very popular.
Over 13,000 over GitHub Stars.

# FInally

# Gets used around lots of companies
CyberAgent, Google, Amazon, Mercari, etc.

# Time passes
Lots of different projects.

# Corona comes
Start wondering what is the purpose of living in a city where you can do nothing.

# Moves to Okinawa
Remote work. 
Try if its possible to live self-sustained.

# Couldn't swim
元々泳げない人でした

# Get very addicted to Spearfishing
週末は魚突き。20メートル潜って、魚と戦う。
〆る。血抜きする。捌く。召し上がる。

# It is not only possible
It is actually extremely fun!
ドーパミン大量に出る.　人間って元々猟師の本能あるな。
素晴らしい。とりあえずAIで全世界の仕事がなくなったとしても。
沖縄にさえ移住してれば魚突きで生きていける。

# Ok after I go to some other projects

# LLMs and AI arrived
I start to notice there is a huge widening gap between people that can read/write English.
Because the speed of new AI information is just too much and too fast to cope up for in Japanese.

# Widening Gap starts getting very big
Almost like 今までと比べて話が通じなくなる
I feel the English gap is bigger than before.
But sure you can use Google Translate right? No.


# I discovered a paper last year that got me shock

## Introducing the paper.
歴史からの驚くべき教訓
明治時代の日本は、わずか17年で世界最先端の技術大国へと変貌を遂げました。

その鍵は何だったのでしょうか？ 西洋の知識を日本語に翻訳し、広く普及させたことです。

今、日本は再びこの戦略を現代に蘇らせ、世界のリーダーへと返り咲く新たな挑戦を始めます。

2024年7月に発表された画期的な研究が、日本の未来を変える可能性を秘めています。

坂部省吾氏、ユハース・レカ氏、ワインスタイン・デイビッド氏 (2024) による 最新の研究 は、明治時代の日本が成し遂げた驚異的な経済発展の秘密を解き明かしました。

この研究結果は、現代の日本に新たな希望と可能性をもたらします。

## 衝撃の事実
1. 1870年：世界の技術書の 84% はたった4言語で独占
🇬🇧 英語、🇫🇷 フランス語、🇩🇪 ドイツ語、🇮🇹 イタリア語
その他の国々は最新技術へのアクセスから実質的に遮断

2. 日本政府の革命的対応：
大規模な翻訳プロジェクトを緊急展開
目標：西洋の知識を日本語に翻訳し、全国民に普及

3. 驚異の結果：

わずか17年で、🇯🇵 日本語の技術書の数が1870年の 🇩🇪 ドイツと同レベルに到達
技術知識面で、日本は一気に世界の先進国に追いついた
この研究結果は、日本の技術革新と経済成長の可能性を明確に示しています。

歴史の教訓を活かし、新たな挑戦を始める時が来たのです。

## 驚異的な成果
この知識革命が日本にもたらした変化は劇的でした。

年	製造業製品の輸出割合
1868	30%未満
1885	20%
1895	60%
さらに、1885年から1899年の間：

日本の労働生産性の成長率：年平均2.7%
これは同時期の一人当たりGDP成長率の2倍以上！

# この論文に興味ある人はこのサイトにまとめた
https://yakushin-manifesto.org/ja/

# だから日本の産業革命の秘密：技術知識の翻訳と体系化

- もっとガイドや本を書く必要がある（ありがとうきのぴーさん！）

#　そして色んな形 
- その最先端の情報を発信するイベント、祭りを作ろうではないか？

# 今の波はAIコードエージェント

今回のイベントに今まで以上に危機感があり、
周りまだちゃんとAI使いこなせる人が少なく、
これはスマホシフト以上にヤバい！ってなった。

# The current growth of power and information
Is not linear now, is exponential.

# Thanks to AI Coding Agents
Claude 3.7の登場により、
Now we are closer that instead of 人間が開発するより、
すでに7割のタスクをAIコーディングエージェントに渡したい。

# What does this mean for 経営者
ビジョナリーな経営者。
Production Readyになる最後のところはエンジニア必要だけど、
最初のプロトタイプ、人を動かすために、
ちゃんとやりたいことをこだわってShigeru Miyamotoのようにエンジニアに伝える上で、
ますます大事になってくる。

LLM進化した先に、才能ある経営者はエンジニア不足とするか、案件を場合に増やすか。

現場に任せるのは非常に危険な時代。
エンジニアすら追いついてない。
ビジネスモデル面でも、できることも、当たり前になる世界も、すべて劇的に変わっている。

自分が理解して体現してないと、表面的なビジネスにだけなり、
稼げなくなる。

# What does this mean for エンジニア
MTエンジニアは趣味になる。
AIエンジニアは仕事ある。

# WHat does this mean for デザイナー・クリエーター
起点力、発想力、行動力が最も大事な要素になったから、
この人たちが一番力発揮できるようになる。

# The end of this chapter
Ok so there is something important:

@oreilly.md

「我々が知っているプログラミングの終焉」

# The 民主化 of programming, designing, even doing 経営

Currently the AI is more intelligent than most humans.
So you just need to work with it.

# Despite your profession.
These are my best two recommendations:
Cursor or Windsurf.

# The best model (today)
Claude 3.7

# They can be used in Enterprise
For example Cursor
- CAって基本ルール各事業部が自由に定める
- セキュリティもOK　SOC2認定されている
- ビジネスプラン
- データが学習されない
- Privacyモード

# 分業の終わり
Specialization has been killed by AI.
Doing 分業 had communication cost.
Now since AI doesnt like to do much 分業.
It likes to speak the same language,　it likes less code (tokens).
Can release A LOT Faster. A LOT! Alone.


# For most apps/services and use cases it makes almost no sense to separate everything
- The FullTS Default Stack
- Frontend TS/React
- Serverless TS
- Native TS/React/Expo

# More and more companies are taking this approach
It increases the productivity A LOT. So much leverage
- Linear（評価額:..., ARR:...）
- Supabase（評価額:..., ARR:...）
- Clerk（評価額:..., ARR:...）
- ロジックス（アセンド株式会社）

# This small team beats big team is demostrated.
Tiny teams are the future:
• Cursor: 0 to $100M ARR in 21 months w/ 20 people (in 12 months  1 億ドル)
• Bolt: 0 to $20M ARR in 2 months w/ 15 people
• Lovable: 0 to $10M ARR in 2 months w/ 15 people

# There is so many paradigm changes
- Nowadays it makes more economic sense to go Serverless using Cloudflare or similars
Rather than spin up instances. Dont spend money when not using

# Any engineer in 2025 should have some experience of the latest paradigms:
- Offline-first
- Serverless
- Realtime 
- Coding Agents
- MCP

# Paradigms

コンピューターアプリの歴史：経営者向け簡易解説
コンピューターアプリケーションの発展は、ビジネスの運営方法に大きな影響を与えてきました。ここでは、技術的な専門用語を使わずに、各時代の特徴とビジネス影響を簡単に説明します。
1. パソコン時代（1980年代-1990年代）
代表例： Windows
ビジネスでの利用：

各社員のパソコンで独立して作業
インターネット接続なしで完結
データは自社内のハードディスクに保存
ソフトは一度購入してインストール

例え話： 自分の机に置いた電卓や手帳のように、必要なものがすべて手元にある状態。他の人と共有するには物理的にファイルを渡す必要がありました。
2. クラウド時代（1990年代後半-2010年代）
代表例： Amazon AWS
ビジネスでの利用：

インターネット接続が必須に
データは遠隔地のサーバーに保存
どこからでもアクセス可能
常時接続が前提のサービス

例え話： 会社の書類を全て本社の書庫に保管し、必要な時に電話で取り寄せるようなもの。書類を見るには常に本社とつながっている必要があります。
3. 自動運用時代（2010年代-2020年代前半）
代表例： AWS Lambda
ビジネスでの利用：

ITインフラの管理が簡素化
使った分だけ支払うモデル
サーバーの心配をせずにサービス開発
柔軟な拡張性

例え話： 電気やガスのように、使った分だけ料金を払うユーティリティモデル。設備の心配をせずにサービスを利用できます。
4. 高速分散時代（2020年代前半）
代表例： Cloudflare
ビジネスでの利用：

世界中で高速にサービス提供
ユーザーに近い場所でデータ処理
グローバル展開が容易に
地域ごとの最適化

例え話： 一つの本社ではなく、世界中に小さな支社を置いて、お客様の近くでサービス提供するようなもの。移動距離が短くなるので対応が速くなります。
5. オフライン共有時代（2020年代後半-現在）
代表例： Firebase、
ビジネスでの利用：

インターネット接続がなくても使える
接続が回復すると自動的に同期
ユーザー体験の大幅な向上
サーバー負荷とコストの削減

例え話： 出張先でもオフィスと同じように作業でき、会社に戻ったら自動的に情報が更新されるようなもの。常に本社と電話をつながなくても仕事ができます。
最新時代（オフライン共有時代）のビジネスメリット

常に動作する： インターネット接続が不安定な環境（出張先、移動中、地下など）でも業務が継続できる
ユーザー体験の向上： 待ち時間が少なく、ストレスなく使えるため、従業員の生産性が向上する
コスト削減： サーバー負荷を減らし、クラウド運用コストを削減できる
信頼性向上： インターネット接続トラブルがあっても業務が止まらないため、ビジネスの安定性が増す
データ主権： ユーザーや企業がデータをより管理しやすくなり、プライバシーやセキュリティの懸念に対応しやすい

この進化の流れを見ると、テクノロジーは「常に接続が必要」な状態から、「オンラインとオフラインのベストな組み合わせ」へと進化していることがわかります。現代のビジネスに最適なのは、ユーザーが気にすることなくシームレスに動作するアプリケーションなのです。

# UXとAX

以下に、UI、UX、DX、そしてAXの進化の詳細解説を提供します：

## UI時代（1980年代〜1990年代）：マッキントッシュ
マッキントッシュはグラフィカルユーザーインターフェース（GUI）を一般ユーザーに広め、コンピューターの使い方を根本から変えました。アイコン、ウィンドウ、マウス操作など、今日でも使われている基本的なUIの概念を確立した時代です。

## UX時代（2000年代〜2010年代）：iPhone
iPhoneの登場により、単なるインターフェースデザインから「ユーザー体験全体」へと焦点が移行しました。タッチスクリーン、AppStore、モバイルアプリのエコシステムは、デバイスの使い方だけでなく、使用者の感情や満足度も考慮したデザイン哲学を広めました。

## DX時代（2010年代〜2020年代）：Stripe
Developer Experience（開発者体験）の時代では、Stripeのような企業が、開発者がAPIを使う体験自体を革新しました。数行のコードで複雑な決済システムを実装できるような直感的なAPI設計と優れたドキュメントにより、開発者の生産性と満足度が飛躍的に向上しました。

## AX時代（2020年代〜現在）：MCP
Agent Experience（エージェント体験）の時代は、AIエージェントがシステムを自律的に操作するための標準化されたプロトコルであるMCPによって象徴されます。初期のGPTベースのエージェントが限定的な成功に留まる中、MCPはコミュニティによって急速に採用された最初の標準プロトコルとなりました。

### MCPとは何か？
Model Context Protocol（MCP）は、AIアプリケーション用の標準プロトコルで、「AIアプリケーション用のUSB-Cポート」と例えられます。USB-Cが様々なデバイスと周辺機器を接続する標準化された方法を提供するように、MCPはAIモデルを異なるデータソースやツールに接続する標準化された方法を提供します。

### なぜMCPが重要か？
- LLM上にエージェントと複雑なワークフローを構築可能
- 事前構築された統合リストにより、LLMが様々なツールに直接接続可能
- LLMプロバイダーやベンダー間での切り替えの柔軟性を提供
- インフラ内でのデータ保護のベストプラクティスを確立

### MCPの2025年前半ロードマップ：
1. **リモートMCP接続**: 認証・認可、サービス発見機能の実装
2. **リファレンス実装**: 充実したクライアント例とプロトコル提案プロセスの整備
3. **配布と発見**: パッケージ管理、インストールツール、サーバーレジストリの開発
4. **エージェントサポート**: 階層型エージェントシステム、インタラクティブワークフローの強化
5. **エコシステム拡大**: コミュニティ主導の標準開発、複数モダリティへの対応
6. **正式な標準化**: 標準化機関による規格化の取り組み

この進化の流れは、単なる技術の進歩ではなく、人間とコンピューターの関係性の変化を表しています。UIからAXへの進化は、人間をより創造的な活動へと解放するための旅なのです。

# Business Changes ALL
今までは B2C か　B2Bかその組み合わせ。
いまはB2A、B2Cなどもありますが、
最も稼ぐであろうビジネスは、A2A。



# A2A Agents Communicate each other
