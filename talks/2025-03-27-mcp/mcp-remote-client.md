If you prefer to use a client like Claude Desktop or Cursor that already supports MCP but doesn’t yet handle remote connections with authentication, you can use mcp-remote. mcp-remote is an adapter that  lets MCP clients that otherwise only support local connections to work with remote MCP servers. This gives you and your users the ability to preview what interactions with your remote MCP server will be like from the tools you’re already using today, without having to wait for the client to support remote MCP natively.
