**Welcome to the RevenueCat Shipaton — the mobile hackathon that’s all about shipping… a ton.**

At RevenueCat, we're all about supporting developers to build and monetize amazing apps. After the overwhelming success of last year’s Shipaton, we’re thrilled to announce the return of our global hackathon.

This **August and September**, we’re inviting developers from all corners of the globe to ship new apps and compete for over **$300,000** in cash prizes and truly unique rewards.

### The challenge

Your mission is simple:

- **Ship a brand-new app** to the iOS, Android, or Mac App Store between August 1st and September 30th, 2025.
- Integrate the **RevenueCat SDK** to power at least one in-app or web purchase.

> Note: Updates to previously released apps won’t qualify - it’s all about bringing something new to life!

### Bigger and better

Last year's Shipaton sparked a frenzy of creativity and innovation across the internet. Developers blew us away by launching incredible apps, producing inspiring YouTube series, flooding social media with #BuildInPublic journeys, and creating insightful shorts on TikTok and Instagram.

_You could receive a coveted “Shippy” award and your app displayed on the iconic “The One” billboard in Times Square!_

Inspired by your amazing contributions, we've upped the ante for 2025:

- Over **$300,000 in cash prizes**.
- Winning apps featured prominently on the **giant billboard in Times Square**.
- Trip to New York City with invites to RevenueCat’s App Growth Annual conference.

### Join the conversation on Discord!

Shipaton isn’t just about shipping code - it’s about community. Whether you’re brainstorming your first idea or prepping for launch day, the official Shipaton Discord is the place to connect, collaborate, and share the journey.

Inside, you’ll find fellow developers from around the world debugging code, creating paywall experiments, discussing launch strategies, and more. Looking to form a team? Need quick feedback? Want to hang out with other shippers? You’ll find it here.

We’ve also created a dedicated #post-engagement-boost channel where you can share your YouTube videos, Tweets, Reddit posts or other build-in-public content so other participants can like, comment or share to help you reach a bigger audience. There’s also a dedicated #launch-day channel for you to share your go-live and get some community support. It’s all about creating a positive, encouraging space where we lift each other up - and help each other ship.

Come say hi and make the most of Shipaton!

### Ready, set, ship!
