Windsurf still has way better context than cursor and understand the intent better, but UI is slower. Tab is way better in Cursor. Neither of those come even close to v0 for anything UI related. V0 is just magical for Frontend. I create components there then move them to cursor and windsurf. Bolt, Lovabke are great to get going but then move to windsurf cursor.

---

Lovable -> Rapid Stripe integration
Bolt -> Rapid  Supabase integration
v0 -> maintained by Vercel to have uber-latest next.js coding standards built in

---

Cursor won, period. Agent in the composer tab is just too damn good

---

The main difference in tools right now is we have the IDE group (Cursor, Windsurf), then we have the full stack platforms (Bolt, Replit, etc.).
I like the IDE model right now better, combined with a best of breed approach vs getting locked into a full platform

---

Replit: Seamless cloud-based coding environment, instant multiplayer collaboration, and built-in hosting.

Bolt: Optimized for speed and lightweight use cases with intuitive interfaces.

v0: Focused on code quality and advanced error correction during iterations.

---

Different target audiences: Lovable and Bolt are much easier for non-developers. Cursor can make developers more productive, but requires coding experience when project get more complex.

---

cursor is great when you have an existing codebase

bolt, etc... are great at creating a new codebase.

I start with bolt, then move to cursor

---

Using Cursor needs some amount of familiarity with coding, setting up databases etc. and I think its a different product when compared to v0 or Replit or Bolt. But you can create better with Cursor and a junior dev can be very quick with Cursor. 

Replit Agent, Bolt, v0 are all essentially prompt to code tools which one can use even if they dont know anything about coding or software development. But output is more like a MVP.

--- 

Cline is just better. It doesn’t limit your token usage so it is smarter and better at making systemic changes. That with built in mcp support make it the most extensible

---

replit agent is way too expensive and doesn’t work super well. i like what they’re trying to do though, hopefully they get that pricing down

---

@Replit bolt target different users than 
@cursor_ai or @windsurf_ai

Replit/bolt mainly target non-devs by lowering the entry barrier via AI and all their integrated features (databases, etc, everything running in browsers, zero setup cost)

cursor/windsurf target software professionals who work in the IDE they’re used to (VSCode forks) and want to / require working with their very own tech stack, on existing codebases.

---

I really enjoy Cursor especially their latest agent update is on point. 

I truly enjoy the Replit ai agent but it feels like the whole benefit of Replit is using their e2e offering and I still tend to doubt it’s ready for production apps / longevity. The vendor lock in is real

---

Replit makes the initial setup and final deployment much simpler and beginner friendly. Cursor seems to be better at execution in the middle phase. Hopefully they both get better at what the other is good at and we all win.

---

I often use v0 before I go to Cursor to start prototyping the interface.

---

Having used mostly cursor and V0, I can confidently say V0 is great at building independent components, cursor is great at putting everything together but requires thorough  context files and rules. I’ve found a sweet spot using them both for their unique strengths

---

I've used them all, and I can say that Cursor has the best executions.

Windsurf is a close second. The main thing Windsurf does better is that it can automatically find and fix any mistakes it makes, including changes it accidentally made to other files.

---

I used all of them - now current favourite is Cline or Roo Cine with Sonnet. It self improves the code by browsing in its own browser, checking responses via curl commands etc. All the other ones you are alone in the dark

---

Bolt - quicker and better designs out of the box. 

Windsurf - better design with same prompt than cursor. More intuitive UX. 

Cursor - Most stable solid workhorse.

DevinやAllHands AI、Claude DesktopのMCP連携、Browser-useなどを触っていたのだが、そんな中でも現時点で一番「もう戻れねえな」と思ったのはCline。ChatGPTにソースコードコピペしながらプロンプトをしこしこ書いて手元で実行していた時代がまるで石器時代のように感じる

ClineはVSCodeの拡張機能でコーディングアシスタントなんだけど、VSCodeとの統合が上手くて、シームレスに目の前でガンガン開発を進めてくれる。エディタも勝手にいじるしコマンドラインも勝手に実行してくれる。MCP連携も可能だからブラウザ見たりSlack見たりもしてくれる。

爆速で開発される様子を横で見ながらツッコミを入れてくのが人間のエンジニアの役割になってる。まじでコーディングの生産性が10倍ぐらいになっている気がする。

しかもSonnet3.5時点でここまでやれてるので、o3レベルのエージェントが入ってきたら普通に過半数のエンジニアは勝てなくなるのではないか。もう殆ど必要な要素技術は揃っている気がするからこれは2025年内に起きる可能性がめちゃくちゃ高い

この辺痛感した
・普段のコミュニケーションが発生している場に組み込むことの大事さ
・人間が見てるコンテクストが勝手に共有されることの便利さ
・フィードバックのコミュニケーションの中で暗黙知になっていたナレッジを自動で蓄積させていく、というUX
・MCP連携の威力
・コマンド自動実行の威力

IntelliJ AI Assistant

Low Tier

Oof. For as good an IDE as 
 makes, its AI assistant is leagues behind ChatGPT4, which is disappointing considering it's supposed to have direct access to my code.

 In Unity gamedev at least, simple tasks produce buggy code with no initialization or error checking, and missing common sense UI things (a delete button whenever you have an add button) are not added since you did not explicitly request them.

 I'm on the trial currently, but this is not looking like something I'd pay for. AI is supposed to handle the boring stuff so I can write the fun stuff, but this has not been the case so far. Gonna give it some time and hope for the best.

 ---

 JetBrains AI Assistant feels pretty dumb compared to Cursor, can't even figure out correct places to insert files/code

 ---

 JetBrainsはターミナルの出力に対してAI Assistant使えないよね。Cursorなら使えるんだけどな〜

この辺、セキュリティ的に既存のIDEは普通アクセスできないよね。

---

Cursor is a big step up from the JetBrains AI assistant. Its main drawback is that it is based on VS Code.

I love the JetBrains products, so I hope this doesn't become their Kodak moment.

---

github copilot + Jetbrains Ai assistantが最高！って思ってたんだけど、もう時代はCursor

---

JetBrains AI Assistant。
月数万してもいいから、Github Copilot並の補間速度や、Cursor並のAIサポート、o1使えたりやトークン数増えても処理可能にして欲しい。
今のところ補完は遅すぎるし、chatはコード量が少し多くなると無いものとされ「質問はなんですか？」と言われる始末

---

I am a long-time, almost daily user of JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm) and GitHub Copilot.

For a short period of time, I also subscribed to JetBrains' AI Assistant. So, in parallel, I had both Copilot (for code completion and IDE chat) and JetBrains AI Assistant (for AI-integrated assistance, commit messages, refactor suggestions, etc.).

When I first encountered the buzz about Cursor AI, I was quite skeptical. I'm not particularly fond of VS Code's coding experience; I prefer a more customized IDE tailored for each language.

However, Cursor AI took it to the next level. It provides the best coding AI assistant experience I've had. CMD+K and CMD+L are now my most frequently used commands.

I should clarify that I mostly use Cursor AI for Next.js and React development, along with some Python and FastAPI work. I also plan to use it for Java and Spring Boot soon.

I've already canceled my Copilot subscription. If Cursor AI proves to be as effective for Java as it is for web development, I might cancel my JetBrains All Products subscription as well.

---

trying out GH copilot in vs code, jetbrains ai assistant and cursor side by side
cursor is mogging the competition it is not even funny

---

Jetbrains IDE is still my favourite (was never a fan of vscode) but the AI Assistant on it is super slow to respond and to apply changes to the code (still doesn’t do a good job at applying the diff).

Compared to that Cursor + Claude is a lot ahead! Faster and does a better job!
