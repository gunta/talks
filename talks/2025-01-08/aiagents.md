# Background

Github Copilot started...
It was the first nice product to do AI autocomplete and "chat with my code".

Then there was Cursor Composer for Generating Code.
AI’s ability to modify multiple parts of a single file or multiple files at the same time

# Reason why Cursor

- Why is not a VSCode plugin:
Some of the features, like the amazing Cursor Tab and CMD-K, are not possible as plugins to existing coding environments.

- Highest quality as Product, currently

- Cursor Flow

- Bought Supermaven 
  - The first code completion tool with a 1 million token context window.
  - 3X Faster responses than the competitors.

- Team of smart people
It's not "just an openai wrapper".
They've built systems including SOTA next-edit-prediction models, multi-billion-file retrieval systems, and fast code rewrites through speculative inference.

- Raised
Raised about 100億円 in Series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, lead of Google AI, and the founders of Stripe, GitHub, Ramp, Perplexity, and OpenAI

Large companies are very slow to react.
Cursor has new model implemented on the same day they are released.


- VSCode ecosystem
It is challenging to replicate the various plugins and expandable capabilities offered by the VSCode ecosystem. So both Github Copilot and Cursor are tools in the VSCode ecosystem.
